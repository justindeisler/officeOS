## Email Types

- Professional but warm tone

- Any blockers or decisions needed
- Next steps with timeline
- No jargon

**Deliverable Handoff:**
- What's included
- How to access/use
- Known limitations
- Support/questions contact

### 2. Team Communication

- Context/background
- Impact on team
- Action required (if any)
- Q&A process

**Request:**
- Specific ask upfront
- Context for why
- Deadline if applicable
- Offer to discuss

**Status Update:**
- Summary first
- Details in bullets
- Blockers highlighted
- Help needed

### 3. Follow-ups

**After Meeting:**
```
Subject: Follow-up: [Meeting Topic] - [Date]

Hi [Name],

Thanks for [meeting/chatting] today. Quick recap:

**Key decisions:**
• [Decision 1]
• [Decision 2]

**Next steps:**
• [You/I] will [action] by [date]
• [They] will [action] by [date]

Let me know if I missed anything.

[Sign-off]
```

**Checking In:**
```
Subject: Quick check-in: [Topic]

Hi [Name],

Just following up on [previous context].

[One sentence asking for what you need]

Happy to [offer something helpful] if that helps move things forward.

[Sign-off]
```

**After No Response:**
```
Subject: Re: [Original Subject]

Hi [Name],

Just bumping this up in your inbox. I know things get busy.

[Restate the ask in one sentence]

If this isn't a priority right now, no worries—just let me know and I'll follow up [later timeframe].

[Sign-off]
```

## Tone Adjustments

### Formal (Enterprise clients, executives)
- Full sentences
- Complete words (no contractions)
- "I would like to..." not "I'd like to..."
- Sign off: "Best regards,"

### Professional (Standard business)
- Clear and direct
- Some contractions OK
- "I'd love to discuss..."
- Sign off: "Best," or "Thanks,"

### Casual (Colleagues, friendly clients)
- Conversational
- Contractions, shorter sentences
- "Let me know what you think!"
- Sign off: "Cheers," or just name

## Structure Framework

**Subject Line:**
- Specific, not vague
- Include action if needed: "[Action Needed]"
- Keep under 50 characters

**Opening:**
- Skip "I hope this email finds you well"
- Get to the point in sentence 1-2
- Context if needed

**Body:**
- One topic per email
- Bullet points for multiple items
- Bold key information
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences)

**Closing:**
- Clear next step
- Deadline if applicable
- Easy response option

## Templates

```
Subject: [Project Name] Proposal - Next Steps

Hi [Name],

Following up on the proposal I sent over on [date] for [project brief description].

I'm available to walk through any questions or adjust the scope based on your feedback.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Starting with "I" too often
- Apologizing unnecessarily
- Being too vague about asks
- Wall of text (use formatting)
- Forgetting the actual request
- Burying important info
